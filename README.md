# Vaccination Management System

The Vaccination Management System is a web application designed to streamline the process of vaccination appointments, administration, and management. It provides functionalities for citizens to schedule appointments, view their appointments, cancel appointments, download vaccination certificates, and for administrators to manage vaccination centers, appointments, and citizen data.

## Installation

To install the frontend, use npm:

npm install

To run the backend, install it as a Spring Boot application.

## Usage

- **Citizens**: Citizens can access the system to schedule appointments, view existing appointments, cancel appointments if needed, and download vaccination certificates.
  
- **Centre Administrators**: Administrators can view appointments at their respective centers, mark citizens as vaccinated upon completion of vaccination, and cancel appointments for absent citizens.
  
- **Central Level Administrators**: Administrators at the central level can create new vaccination centers, modify center details, issue new Aadhar cards (necessary for citizen sign-up), and print Aadhar cards.
